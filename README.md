# Hotel Reservation System

## Overview
This project is a Hotel Reservation System developed using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). It allows users to perform various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to hotel room reservations. Users can reserve a new room, view existing reservations, update reservation details, delete reservations, check room availability, and exit the system.

## Features
- **New Reservation**: Users can reserve a new room by providing necessary details such as guest information, check-in/out dates, room type, etc.
- **View Room**: Users can view details of existing room reservations, including guest information, room type, check-in/out dates, etc.
- **Get Room No.**: Users can search for available rooms based on their preferences such as room type, check-in/out dates, etc., and get the room numbers of available rooms.
- **Update Reservation**: Users can update existing reservation details such as guest information, check-in/out dates, room type, etc.
- **Delete Reservation**: Users can cancel existing room reservations.
- **Check Reservations**: Users can check the availability of rooms for a given date range and room type.
- **Exit**: Users can exit the system when done.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core programming language used for developing the application logic.
- **JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**: Used to interact with the database management system (DBMS) to perform CRUD operations on the hotel reservation data.
- **MySQL (or any other supported DBMS)**: The database management system used to store hotel reservation data.
- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: An IDE such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans can be used for development.

## Setup
1. **Database Setup**: Set up the MySQL database and create the necessary tables to store hotel reservation data.
2. **Project Setup**: Clone the project repository and import it into your preferred IDE.
3. **Dependency Management**: If using Maven, ensure that the necessary JDBC driver dependencies are added to the project's `pom.xml` file.
4. **Database Configuration**: Configure the database connection details (e.g., URL, username, password) in the project's JDBC connection class.
5. **Run**: Build and run the project to start the Hotel Reservation System.

## Usage
